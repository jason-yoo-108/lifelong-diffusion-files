# Offline Learning vs. Lifelong Learning GIFs

Each folder of this repository contains model-generated samples from a specific training algorithm.

Each video file consists of 5 video clips. The topmost clip, highlighted with a red border, represents the ground truth video.
The remaining 4 clips show model-generated samples. In these clips, the first few frames (also marked with a red border) are provided as conditioning frames, while the remaining frames are autoregressively generated using different random seeds.

Below are example model sample comparisons between Offline Learning and Lifelong Learning configurations.
For all comparisons, the left and right videos depict Offline Learning and Lifelong Learning respectively.
Additional model samples are present in the repository's folders.
